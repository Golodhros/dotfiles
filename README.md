# Marcos's Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.

## What Is This?

Dotfiles to help setup a Mac machine with my personal setup.
Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles.

## For a Fresh Install

1. Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement
2. Copy public and private SSH keys to `~/.ssh`. Make sure they're set to `600`
3. Clone this repo by doing `git clone https://github.com/Golodhros/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
4. Copy and paste `.dotfiles_env` and `.bash_profile` into your home folder (lookout with rewriting yours)
